Verisitas was a high ranked villager in the village lead by Karcyn. When came time for the ritual for the new village head. Karcynson disturbed this. Verisitas ran away with the apprentice Regina of Karcyn and a couple vilagers.

During the war of the gods he used some found divinium to experiment with spells and accidentally made himself and his now wife(The apprentice Regina) immortal. He became a prophet as the remaining villagers turned into a group following him(The verisiti). Verisitas preached the proper use of magic, not bending it to your will, but guiding it.

The people still using magic to this day are descendants of the Verisiti.

Verisitas and Regina whereabouts are not known
