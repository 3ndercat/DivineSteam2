### Clear a path
By using the steamvents on your back you can make a charge that is all of your movement speed long. This takes 4 levels of gas. Everyone in the charge has to roll a strength save. If failed the target takes 1d6 damage, if succeeded the target takes Â½ 1d6 damage. Either way the enemy is pushed out of the path to a side you decide.
