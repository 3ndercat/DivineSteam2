# Fraud
Expertise: Deception

### Mask of many faces
You can create a new character from scratch or impersonate somebody. This can take a day if it is just speech, behaviour and writing, or it takes half a week including 20 gp to get the right outfit.

### Expert cheat
As an expert in tricking the mind you have the ability to win every gamble game, for this you have to roll a deception check against the passive perception of the other players.

### Scapegoat
You can sometimes cause another creature to suffer an attack meant for you. When you are targeted by an attack while a creature within 5 feet of you is granting you cover against that attack, you can use your reaction to have the attack target that creature instead of you.
