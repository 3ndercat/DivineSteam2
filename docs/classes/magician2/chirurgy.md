# Chirurgy
Chirurgy is the study of medicine through a magical lens. Magicians in this college learn how to use their magic to better heal others and improve their lives by strengthening the aetheric patterns that define
them. As such, chirurgeons are highly sought after and well-paid to keep their patients healthy beyond the limitations of modern medicine.

## Level 3
### Expert Healer
When you take this archetype at 3rd level, your concentration in remedial magic makes your healing spells more potent. Whenever you cast a spell that restores Hit Points to a creature, including yourself, the creature regains additional Hit Points equal to 2 + the spell’s **Appetance** cost up to their Hit Point maximum.

## Level 7
### Self Preservation
Starting at 7th level, you have either learned to trick the magical energy within creatures into thinking it’s invulnerable or you apply a pain numbing medicine. 

When you touch a creature, including yourself, you can give them Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing Damage for one minute. After the minute has ended, the creature loses one Hit Die. If the creature had no more Hit Dice, they instead gain a level of Exhaustion.

## Level 11
### Stimulate Healing
Starting at 11th level, you learn how to make creatures reweave their own **Appetance** to heal themselves. <br>
As an Action, you can touch a creature, and they may immediately spend their Hit Dice to heal themselves. If they roll a 1 on a Hit Die, they can choose to reroll and must use the new roll.

## Level 15
### Pure Pattern
Starting at 15th level, you’ve strengthened your own **Appetance** so much so that it is difficult to alter. <br>
You are immune to disease and poison, you have Resistance to Poison Damage, and you have Advantage on any Saving Throws against being Blinded or Deafened.

## Level 18
### Master Chirurgeon
Starting at 18th level, your healing power is so great that you can maximise the effect of your spells. <br>
Whenever you cast a spell that requires you to roll dice to determine Hit Points restored, you may instead receive the maximum amount possible.
