# Magician
The combination of spectacle and magic is what the modern day wizard, sorcerer and bard have become. The preserved knowledge of families about the **Arcane** is what allows somebody's inherent energy come to fruition. By shaping a spell and exerting it within the art of **Thaumaturgy**, the Magician makes the impossible possible. Wheter that be through the shock of healing wounds at an instant, or through the comedic and whimsical displays of dissapearance. 

Though the era of mages regrowing limbs and teleporting across realms is over, mordern magicians can still put their power to use. Kowledge on the supernaturnal and occult have made Magicians believe that they are nescessary to keep the world safe, while also keeping the masses entertained.

The art of **Thaumaturgy** requires rumorous training to harness. Most Magicians must start training from a young age to truly harness. This costs time and money, and thus, the role of Magician is often placed upon nobles.

## Level 1
### Thaumaturgy
You are trained in the magical art of **Thaumaturgy**. You’ve turned your body into a conduit for magic though spectacle. You draw magical energy from your surroundigs and reshape it into something new. The energy; also known as ***Appetance***, is used to create such spells and returns to you once their power has been unleashed.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the **Magician** spell list. You learn additional **Magician** cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the ***Magician** table.

#### Spells
You have a pool of ***Appetance*** equal to your Level. You spend ***Appetance*** from this pool whenever you wish to cast a spell

You learn two spells at 1st level from the **Magician** spell list. <br>
Since magic has been lost in the world, you are not able to  learn any spells whenever you level up. To acquire more spells, you must acquire them through **scrolls**, **passed on knowledge**, or rugirous **observation** within the world.

You can cast any spell that you know at any time, as long as you have sufficient ***Appetance*** remaining. You regain all spent ***Appetance*** when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Spellcasting Ability
***Intelligence*** or ***Charisma*** is your spellcasting ability for your ***Magician*** spells. You use your ***Intelligence*** or ***Charisma*** whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. <br>
In addition, you use your ***Intelligence*** or ***Charisma*** Bonus when setting the Saving Throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an Attack Roll with one.

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your ***Intelligence*** or ***Charisma*** Bonus <br>
**Spell atack Bonus** = your your Proficiency Bonus + your ***Intelligence*** or ***Charisma*** Bonus

### Force of Will
You can spend your body’s energy to provide more
***Appetance*** when necessary.<br>

In addition you may spend Hit Dice and accept levels of Exhaustion if you do not have enough ***Appetance*** to cast a spell. You may only spend Hit Dice equal to half the spells level rounded up, while the rest of the spell must be fueled with levels of Exhaustion.<br>
For example: With 1 ***Appetance***, casting a 4th level spell will cost 1 ***Appetance***, 2 Hit Dice and 1 Exhaustion.<br>
If this effect causes you to become so exhausted that you will die, then you may still act for the remainder of your turn before dying, enabling you to cast the spell that drained you.

## Level 2
### The Show Must Go On
Starting at 2nd level, your basic training as a **Magician** allows you to recuperate faster than most. Whenever you take at least one level of Exhaustion from the *Force of Will* ability, you may remove 1 level of Exhaustion on a ***Short Rest*** and 2 on a ***Long Rest***.

## Level 3
### Magician College
Starting at 3rd level, you choose a thaumaturgical college to focus your magical studies. <br>
Choose from [**Chirurgy**](chirurgy.html), **Manipulator** and [**Escapist**](escapist.html). Your archetype grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.

## Level 4
### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. You may also choose a feat instead.

## Level 5



## Level 6
## Arcane Flourish
At 6th level, your mastery of magical spectacle allows you to create a performance through the manipulation of the world.<br>
As an Action you can perform a Flourish, a dramatic, deliberate act that reshapes how the spell manifests.

A Flourish grants one temporary magical effect of your choice:

- **Emanating Magic.** The area around you shimmers with magical energy. Allies within 10 feet of you gain a bonus to one ability check of your choice until your next turn equal to your proficiency bonus.

- **Kinetic Emphasis.** You can subtly push or pull a creature, object, or hazard up to 10 feet as part of the Flourish. If the creature is not willing it must make a Strength Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC to resist being pushed or pulled.

- **Dramatic Presence.** The Flourish leaves a lasting impression. Any creature that sees it may be awed or intimidated. The DM can grant a reaction bonus on a Persuasion, Intimidation, or Deception check at the start of their next turn.

You have a number of uses equal to your Spellcasting Ability Modifier.


## Level 10
### Sustained Appetance
At 10th level, your magical conduit has stabilized.

When you roll initiative and have no **Appetance** remaining, you regain **Appetance** equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1).<br>
Additionally, once per ***Short Rest***, when you cast a spell using Force of Will, you may choose to reduce the total Exhaustion cost of that casting by 1.
