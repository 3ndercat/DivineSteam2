## Arms


## Head
### Goggles
Gives advantage on perception and investigation. The mechanic also gains darkvision.


## Body

### Kinetic plating
A plating system in your armour made up of springs and latches<br>
When hit with a physical weapon the armour plating will absorb some of the impact(-1 damage if it is bludgeoning, piercing or slashing). It can do this two times and it then becomes "charged". On the next hit the latches flip open and release the compressed springs, this causes the attacker to also receive half of the damage dealt. 

## Misc
### Proximity bombs (Level 2+)
Small rectangular devices that explode upon a creature coming within 5ft. The "target" has to roll a dex save. On a failed save they receive 1d8+Wis fire damage, on a successful save half this.<br>
They can be made for 2 silver worth of components a piece.<br>
Only two can be carried at a time.<br>
