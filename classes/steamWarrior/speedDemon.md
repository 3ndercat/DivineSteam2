# SpeedDemon
+5 Movement speed

### Disengage
A speeddemon can propel themselves backwards 10ft as a bonus action, this takes 1 level of gas. This propel backwards does not invite an attack of opportunity as the enemy has steam blown into their face.

### Swift strike
By using the steamvents in your arms armor you can increase the speed at which you attack, causing you to make double the attacks for 2 consecutive rounds, this takes 2 levels of gas. *This can be combined with the steam damage of steam powered weapons.

### Run and hit
At the expense of 2 levels of gas you can propel yourself a distance of your movement speed+5 towards an enemy not within 5ft if you. You may make an attack roll against this enemy within the same turn. You have a guaranteed 1d4 damage even if you don’t hit your attack.

### Flight
*Only when combined with wingsuit* A speeddemon can launch themselves into the air 20ft at the cost of 4 levels of gas, after this they can glide further. As your furnace is heavy you gain no levels of gas during flight as this is directly used to make sure you don’t plummet down.
