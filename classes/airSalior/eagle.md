### Skill: 
Perception(if you already have perception +2 the modifier)

### Far view
You can use an action to focus your eyes, with this you can view something that is further than 1 mile away and identify it. You can also look through rain as if it were a clear sky. 

### Distant striker
Twice per short rest you increase your ranged attacks capabilities.
For ranged attacks your standard/disadvantage/impossible changes to advantage/neutral/disadvantage/(100ft)impossible. So if a weapon has a range of say: 200/400, for you this is up to 200 feet advantage, then to 400 feet normal, past 400 disadvantage and then after 500 impossible.

### Space percepter
If something is within sight you can guess how far away it is with 90% accuracy.
